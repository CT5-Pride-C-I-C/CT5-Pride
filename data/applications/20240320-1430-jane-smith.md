  Dear CT5 Pride Team,

  I am excited to apply for the Social Media Manager position at CT5 Pride. With over 3 years of experience managing social media accounts for non-profit organizations and a deep commitment to LGBTQ+ advocacy, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

  My previous work with the Rainbow Youth Network demonstrated my ability to grow engagement and create meaningful connections with the LGBTQ+ community. I increased our follower base by 200% and developed successful campaigns that reached over 50,000 people.

  I am particularly drawn to CT5 Pride's grassroots approach and commitment to inclusivity. I would love to contribute my skills to amplify your message and help create an even more vibrant and connected community.

  Thank you for considering my application.

  Best regards,
  Jane Smith
